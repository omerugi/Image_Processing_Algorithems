# Image Processing Algorithms
###### *Implemented by: Lilach Mor, Omer Rugi.*

In the growing world of computer vision, there is still a lot of usage in classic *Image Processing* algorithms.
So to understand them better and how they work, we have implemented them in `Python` - We focused on the well-known and commonly used algorithms.There are three files each one with different algorithms and simple code to show an example of the results.

## How to run:
Each one of the folders contains several implementations of different algorithms - file `ex{num}_util`.
To run an example to see the results of our implantation - run file `ex{num}_main`.
